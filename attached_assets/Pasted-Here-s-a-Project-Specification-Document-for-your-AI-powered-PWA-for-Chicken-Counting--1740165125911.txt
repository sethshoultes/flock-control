# **Project Specification: AI-Powered PWA for Chicken Counting**  

## **1. Project Overview**  
This project is a **Progressive Web App (PWA)** that uses **OpenAI Vision API** to detect and count chickens in an image or live camera feed. The app will be **lightweight and minimal**, focusing solely on scanning, counting, and maintaining a simple history of past counts.  

---

## **2. Key Features & Functional Requirements**  

### **Core Features**  
‚úÖ **Image Scanning**: Users can upload an image or take a picture with their device‚Äôs camera.  
‚úÖ **AI-Powered Counting**: The image is processed via **OpenAI Vision API**, and the estimated chicken count is displayed.  
‚úÖ **Basic History Tracking**: The app stores past counts for the user to reference.  

### **Non-Functional Requirements**  
‚ö° **PWA Compatibility**: Should work on **mobile and desktop browsers**.  
‚ö° **Cloud-Based AI Processing**: No local AI model‚Äîuses **OpenAI‚Äôs API** for counting.  
‚ö° **Minimalist UI/UX**: No extra features beyond scanning and history tracking.  
‚ö° **Internet Connectivity Required**: The app relies on API calls.  
‚ö° **Security Considerations**: User images are processed via OpenAI API, with no storage of raw images.

## **3. User Workflow**  

1Ô∏è‚É£ **User opens the app** in a browser.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **User captures an image** (or uploads an existing one).  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Image is sent to OpenAI Vision API**, which analyzes and returns the estimated chicken count.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **The count is displayed**, along with an option to save it to history.  
5Ô∏è‚É£ **User can access past counts** from a simple history page.

## **4. Technical Stack**  

| Component        | Technology Choice |
|-----------------|------------------|
| **Frontend (PWA)** | React.js |
| **Camera Integration** | WebRTC or HTML5 Camera API |
| **AI Processing** | OpenAI Vision API |
| **Storage (for history)** | LocalStorage or IndexedDB (for simplicity) |

## **5. API Integration Details**  

- **API Used**: OpenAI Vision API  
- **Request Format**:  
  - Input: Image (uploaded or taken from the camera)  
  - Output: JSON response containing the detected object count (chickens)  
- **Example API Call**:  
  ```json
  {
    "image": "base64_encoded_image",
    "task": "count_objects",
    "object_type": "chicken"
  }
  ```
- **Expected Response**:  
  ```json
  {
    "count": 23
  }
  ```

## **6. Constraints & Risks**  
üî¥ **Accuracy Limitations**: AI may not perfectly count chickens in cluttered environments.  
üî¥ **Processing Time**: API calls introduce some delay (~1-3 sec).  
üî¥ **Internet Dependence**: No offline mode, as AI processing is cloud-based.  

---

## **7. Development Roadmap**  

### **Phase 1: AI Integration (1-2 Weeks)**  
‚úÖ Implement OpenAI Vision API testing  
‚úÖ Validate object detection accuracy  
‚úÖ Create a test script for image processing  

### **Phase 2: PWA Development (2-4 Weeks)**  
‚úÖ Build basic React UI (camera, upload, display results)  
‚úÖ Implement API calls for real-time counting  
‚úÖ Add basic history tracking  

### **Phase 3: Testing & Optimization (1-2 Weeks)**  
‚úÖ Performance testing on mobile/desktop  
‚úÖ UX testing and refinements  

---

## **8. Success Criteria**  

‚úî The app can scan an image and return an **approximate count** of chickens.  
‚úî The UI is **simple and easy to use** on both desktop and mobile.  
‚úî The history feature **stores past counts** reliably.

### **Next Steps**  
I‚Äôll now proceed with **Phase 1: AI Testing** by creating an API test script. Let me know if you want to modify anything before we move forward! üöÄ
